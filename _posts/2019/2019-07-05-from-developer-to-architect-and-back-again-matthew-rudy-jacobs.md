A year ago I was looking for a job, and ended up taking a job as a “Technical Architect”.

But what exactly is a Technical Architect?

Weren’t Software Architects a thing in the 90s, cast away when we learnt about Agile?

In this talk I’m going to tell the story of my year in government as a Technical Architect, and hopefully convince you that there is a place for just enough architecture in modern software development.

And maybe it’s a role you’d be interested in
