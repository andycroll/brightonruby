description: "Running Ruby 0.95"

Cast your mind back to the year 1995. Gansta’s Paradise is the top hit of the year. Friends is the hottest show on TV.

And just days after I turn nine, Matz releases Ruby publicly for the first time.

In this talk I go back to Ruby 0.95 and see what it takes to get it running on modern hardware.
