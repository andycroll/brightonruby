It’s been said that programmers like garbage collectors, so let’s take a look at Ruby’s GC! In this talk we'll walk through how Ruby allocates objects, then talk about how we can optimize object layout and memory usage via compaction. Finally we’ll take a look at how to actually build a compacting GC for Ruby as well as the interesting challenges that can be found within.
