We all know that testing is important. But it’s also hard to get right. We’ll talk about how to write effective tests that not only protect against defects in our code, but encourage us to write better quality code to begin with.

You’ll leave this talk with ideas on the philosophies that should inform your tests, and a good idea of what makes a good test suite.
