This is a talk about the process and product of code. It’s a talk about the open source community, about maintenance and tests. About starting projects from existing repositories, using existing APIs, and copy/pasting existing lines of code as that big, scary word we call plagiarism looms over a 21st century newsroom.

It’s a talk about building something the right way under deadline. About humans who write algorithms that determine the news. It’s about bias and about the function it serves. About the privileges and perspectives that programmers bring to their code and about the privileges and perspectives that journalists bring to their stories.
