You might not realise it, but your Ruby project probably relies on a popular configuration-first OSS project. The `tzdata` library is updated regularly as time zones and daylight savings rules change more often than you might think!

By building a project configuration first, rather than focussing on one programming language, you can get a much wider range of people contributing to your open source package. We built a Ruby gem for public holidays that covered 71 countries. By converting it to a configuration first project we were able to release packages for Ruby, Node.js and Perl so that more people could use the data and weâ€™d be more likely to get patches and bug fixes.
