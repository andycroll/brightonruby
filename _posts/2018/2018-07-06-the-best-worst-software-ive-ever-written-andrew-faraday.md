You may remember Andrew from previous Brighton Ruby conferences (as well as those in London, Scotland, and the USA) where he's been providing light relief in the form of the panel game Just A Minute.

This year, instead, he’ll be revealing the technology behind the show, and sharing what he’s learned from the project.
