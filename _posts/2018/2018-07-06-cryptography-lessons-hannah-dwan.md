The Matasano Crypto Challenges - or Cryptopals, to give them their much kinder, Saturday morning cartoon name - are a series of coding challenges, made by Matasano Security (now a part of NCC group). They challenge you to think about cryptography, security, and teach you the motions of how to encrypt, decrypt, and attack.

It’s not wildly complex, it’s not a set of logic systems above everything you already know if you can put together FizzBuzz. As an apprentice, a key part of my job is to learn - Cryptopals, regardless of your own expertise, is one of the most rewarding ways to learn Ruby, to learn logic, and to learn how all the encryption you rely on works.
